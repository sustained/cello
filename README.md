## Project Information

### What is this?

This is a [Trello](https://www.trello.com/) clone (a kanban board).

I'm primarily using it to learn more about Vue, Vuex and Vue-Router.

### Why a Trello clone?

I use Trello a lot and I quite like it, it's pretty great software but there's definitely a few things I wouldn't mind trying to do differently!

So, why not?

### How will this be different?

See the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/yj3Lb4Gu/project-cello) (ironic, I know) if you're curious about my ideas.

### When will it be done?

Soonâ„¢?

### Where is it hosted?

It isn't, yet. But if there's demand, maybe I'll do that.

### Who are you?

- I spend arguably far too much time on [Discord](https://www.discordapp.com/) (sustained#2329).
- I have a [website](https://www.sustained.name/) but it doesn't do much yet.
- I don't really _get_ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@susDissonance) but it exists.
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@sustained) is a thing, also.
- Here on [Github](https://github.com/sustained) you can('t) find my private repos for abandoned projects!
